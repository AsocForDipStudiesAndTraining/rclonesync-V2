test_extended_char_paths

Tests handling of extended chars in:
	Path1, Path2
	--check-filename
	--filters-file (path and filename)

Not tested:
	--rclone   - Could be done by creating a symbolic link to rclone in the workdir, but not portable to Windows
	--config   - Ditto
	--workdir  - Currently hardcoded in testrcsync.py
